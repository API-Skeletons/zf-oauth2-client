ZF OAuth2 Client
================

This client is written to connect to zf-oauth2 specifically.  Connecting to any OAuth2 service is out of scope for this project.  

When you write an application which includes [zfcampus/zf-oauth2](https://github.com/zfcampus/zf-oauth2) this module is written to connect easily and cleanly with your application.  You do not need to write a specific adapter for this client because an adapter for zf-oauth2 is already included.
